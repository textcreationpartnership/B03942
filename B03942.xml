            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu have here the <hi>Manual</hi> fitted for your Devout Exercise, in a more port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Volum, and better answering to its Name, than some former Impressions had render'd it; yet not only entire in all its pious Contents, but also enlarged with divers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pieces of Devotion, &amp; purged from many, both gross <hi>Errata</hi>'s in the <hi>Print,</hi> and improprieties in the <hi>Translations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this the only benefit; For here you shall find the <hi>Hymns</hi> rendred according to the corrected Latine of P. <hi>Ʋrban</hi> 8. (now generally used in the Church) and those too in far more exact and Musical Numbers, than the former. And if some few of the less affectuous and more seldom used have been omitted, it was to make room for a greater advantage to the rest; by continuing on at full length their following <hi>Antiphons</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> and delivering them from most of those puzzling References and <hi>Etceterat</hi>'s, which discouraged too many from reciting them, and could not but interrupt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract all that had them not by heart.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:174457:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But the main and justest glory of this last</hi> Edition, <hi>is a large and exquisit Body of</hi> Litanies, <hi>so strong, and yet so sweet; so affectuous, and yet so instructive; so rigorously ordered and expressed, yet so soft and naturally flowing, in fine, so intirely comprehensive, and yet so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately proportioned, that it is impossible they can be attended to, without rendering their Readers wisely devout; nor practised, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out engaging attention; nor once read, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inveigling into a continual practise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides this Book will afford you an exact</hi> Calender, <hi>with those</hi> Holy-days <hi>only in</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, <hi>which are to be observed by the last Institution, and the rest filled up with such select Names out of the Churches vast Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as are generally known among us, now to be most remarkable for particular exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plariness; such as are aptest upon the very hearing, to hint movingly to us the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and imitable vertues. And for all this no more is exacted of you, than that you make often and good use of it, for your Souls health, and sometimes remember those in your Prayers, who have contributed their Pains to so good a work.</hi>

In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men: and the Light shined in Darkness, and the Darkness did not comprehend it. There was a Man sent from God, whose name was <hi>Iohn.</hi> This man came for a Testimony, to give Testimony of the Light, that all might believe through him. He was not the Light. It was the True Light which lightneth every man that comes into this World. He was in the World, and World was made by Him, and the World know Him not. He came into his own, &amp; his own received him not. But as many as received Him, He gave them power to be made the Sons of God, to those that believe in His Name. Who, not of Blood, nor of the will of Flesh, nor of the will of Man, but of God are born. <hi>And the Word was Flesh, and dwels in us</hi> (and we saw the glory of him, the glory as it were, of the only begotten of the Father) full of Grace and Verity.</p>

                  <p>O Infinite goodness, and inestimable charity, wherewith thou, O Son of God, didst descend from Heaven for our salvation! Thou tookest on thee the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, not of Angels, and deckedst the same with immortality, (the Crown of thy holy Resurrection) thou hast carried it above all Heavens, above the seats of all Angels, beyond the Cherubins, and Seraphins, placing it on the right hand of thy Eternal Father.</p>
                  <p>This now the Angels praise, and all the holy powers of Heaven fall flat before thy Majesty; and each degree of thy Celestial Spirits tremble at the sight of Him, who in an admirable union, is both God and man. This is my only comfort, this my special

                  <p>And, though I confess my self a most wretched sinner, yet I despair not of the communion of thy grace: For well I know thou can'st not forget man, whose nature thou hast put on, and wearest upon thee for his sake, but wilt declare thy self a most merciful God, in the tender affection thou bearest to thy faithful servants, who in thee are risen, &amp; ascended into Heaven, and with thee sit in everlasting glory; for we are thy Members, and thou our Head, having flesh of our flesh, and bones of our bones; and who is he that hateth his own flesh? but contrariwise loveth, cherisheth, and maketh much of it.</p>
                  <p>O wonderful Mystery, wherein thou, O Lord, art united to thy holy Church. Wherefore, I beseech thee, O merciful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, make me partaker of the comfort of thy holy Resurrection &amp; Ascention, that being supported with thy heavenly grace

                  <p>O Blessed Lord, Father, Son, and holy Ghost, three Persons, and one God, my Maker, my Redeemer, my Comforter, my Defender, my Refuge, my Strength, my Victory, my Joy, and my eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: I humbly adore thee, O blessed Trinity, for that thou art in thy self the highest good, from whom floweth all goodness: Thou art eternity, thou art eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou art only God, and there is none besides thy self.</p>
                  <p>I bless and glorifie thee, O Sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who of nothing hast framed Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and all the Creatures therein; who hast made the holy Angels eternally to praise thee in thy glorious Palace, and faithfully assist us in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable exile; who, to declare thy ineffable goodness, createdst all thing for man, and man with thy proper hands, to thine own image and similitude, only for thy self, bestowing on him understanding▪ and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring him with free-will. Blessed, O Lord, be thy Name, for this so inestimable a gift.</p>

                  <p>Thou placedst him in Paradise, flowing with delights, that he might possess and govern all things here below, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by thy blessings to love and serve thee, be translated, after a certain period of time, to the inheritance of eternal bliss. Nor didst thou make these noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Angles, and men, for any necessity thou hadst of them, all things being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in thee to thy eternal joy and glory: But meerly by thy Charity, wast thou mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to create them, that they might be partakers of thy unseparable felicity.</p>
                  <p>I praise thy mercy, O my God, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all thy works, it pleased thee to make me a reasonable Creature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on me so many particular blessings.</p>
                  <p>O merciful Lord, what shall I say to thee for all thy benefits? what praise and thanks shall I yeald thee? I confess my self unworthy to receive the least of thy mercies, unworthy to offer thee thanks for those I have received: But, according to my weak capacity, I bless thy holy Name; and from the bottom of my Soul, wish all honor, and glory, and adoration, may be given thee by all thy Creatures, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>O my God, my ineffable Sweetness, turn into Bitterness all carnall consolations which withdraw me from the love of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial things; suffer me not, my God, to be overcome by the temptations of flesh and blood: suffer me not to be deceived by the world, and its transitory glory, nor that the Devil, through his subtility, seduce me to perdition, Give me strength to resist, patience to endure, and constancy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe: Even meat and drink, and all other necessaries of this life are painful, and troublesome to a devout spirit. Therefore grant me, O Lord, at least to use them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly, that my heart be not too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with the desire of them. Thy holy Law forbids us to seek superfluities, and such as are more delightful than profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:

For these, O Lord, end all other thy inestimable benefits, I yield thee most humble, and obedient thanks, offering my self wholy to thee, as I am wholly thine, beseeching thee also of thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite clemency, to preserve me this night from any ways offending thee, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all my thoughts, words, and works, to thy everlasting glory.

                  <p>GRant me, most merciful God, a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent zeal to desire such things as are most acceptaple to thee, and a faithful dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to search after them; give me wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to find them, &amp; thy grace to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish them; to the praise and glory of thy holy Name. Direct thou my life, that I may both have knowledge, will, and power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to do that which is most pleasing to thee, and most expedient for my own Soul.</p>
                  <p>Let my way to thee, O Lord, be sure, strait, &amp; perfect, that neither adversity, nor prosperity make me faint or fall away from thee, that I be not puffed up in pride with the one, nor driven down into despair by the other: But for the one give thanks, &amp; be in the other armed with patience. That I may rejoyce in nothing but that which draws me to thee, my blessed Jesu, nor sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for any thing but that which withdraws me from thee; that I desire to please, or displease none but thee, and for thee; that all transitory things may for thy sake, be of no reputation with me, &amp; whatever is agreeable to thy will, may be delightful to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:174457:92"/> mine, and thou my God above all things; that I may have no joy besides thee: nor desire of any thing but thee; Let all labour delight me, that is taken for thee, and all ease be unplesant that is without thee.</p>
                  <p>Make me lift up my heart often to thee, and when I forgot thee, give me grace to call to mind my sins with sorrow, and full purpose of amendment; Grant that I may be obedient, without contradiction; pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, without murmuring; pure, without corruption; humble, without counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting; cheerful, without levity; sad, without dejection: true, without double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; fearing thee, without despair; to do good works, put not to presume; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my neighbour his fault without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; instructing him both by word and example, without scorning or taunting.</p>
                  <p>Grant me, most loving Lord, a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful minde, which no worldly thought may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

And, in respect of thy most grievous pains suffered on thee Cross for me, that I may willingly suffer penance and all tribulation for thee.</p>

Of my self, O Lord, I am corrupt and blind in my affections and desires; and, if I rely on my own judgment, easily seduced into error, easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcome by temptation; Wherefore, to thee (O Lord) I wholly offer and commit my Soul.</p>

                  <p>O holy and blessed Trinity, God omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, I commend to thee all my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, both Spiritual and Temporal, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thee my Benefactors, my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, my Friends, my Familiars, and all those for whom I ought to pray, and who desire my Prayers.

                  <p>O my God, what thanks am I bound to yield thy goodness, who hast so lovingly vouchsafed to shew me, and all the faithful that follow thee, the true and strait way to thy Kingdom! Thy Holy life is our way, &amp; by thy patience we walk to thee, who art our head &amp; Governor: But that thou, Lord, hast led the way, who ever would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to follow? O how many would have tarried behind, if they had not seen thy blessed example going before! we are yet slow &amp; dull, though we have seen and heard thy signs &amp; doctrines; what should we then have been, if no such light had shined before us? certainly we should never have raised our thoughts to thee, but wholly fixed our mind, and love on worldly things.</p>

                  <p>O Most Heavenly King and Saviour Jesu Christ, behold I come to thee fainting under the burthen of my sin, &amp; far from the perfection thou commandest. My consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily accuses me, and more and more I am convinced of my failty. In all the imaginations of my heart, in all my words, &amp; what ever I do or leave undone, whether I eat or drink, or sleep, or wake, still I find my life full of imperfections, and with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I often see thy Maj. offended. Whither shall I turn me, O Lord? whither shall I go for mercy? Thou requirest integrity of life and justice, that I should walk in thy holy Commandments, and promisest me thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious help: But, O Lord, I feel my own will so perverse, that I cannot heartily so much as wish and desire those things which are requisite to my salvation. I have no true and sincere purpose to bewail my sins, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent my wickedness from the bottom of my heart, I am too much carried away with the vanity of this life, and too often forget the benefits of thy death. My offences are so many in number, and so grievous in weight, (O gracious God) that, but for thy infinite mercy, I had been long since cast into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:174457:115"/> torment. Wherefore I most humbly thank thy unspeakable goodness, for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me this time of repentance, and that I am not already sunk into the bottomless pit of eternal misery.</p>
                  <p>But what shall I do? shall I despair? shall I say with cursed <hi>Cain,</hi> the murtherer of his Brother, My offences are greater than can be forgiven? God forbid I should have any such thought: But this I will say, My God is merciful and full of pity; he is my comfort and my strength, my refuge and defence; he will not despise the work of his own hand, nor cast from before him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting sinner.</p>
                  <p>To thee I come, most merciful Saviour, opening in thy sight the thoughts of my heart, for thou never failest me with thy gracious help: I confess, most merciful Lord, before thee my weakness, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my own imperfection, and bewail the mult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>O everlasting Sweetness! O unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mercy! O most loving Father! I have so often, and so many ways offended against Heaven and thee, that I am not worthy to be reputed thy Child. Accept me, O Lord, for one of thy hired servants, and feed me

Take from me the fond love of this transitory world, quench in me all impure and unchaste thoughts, and enkindle in my soul a burning desire of thy glorious bliss.</p>
                  <p>Grant me, Almighty God, true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my sins, and thy grace to lament the want of sorrow for my offences. Grant me recōnciliation to thee through the comfortable Sacrament of Penance; and in the end to be received into the blessed company of thy Elect.

                  <p>I have lost thee, and my self also, O my God, by the inordinate love that I bear to my self; and, in seeking thee again, I have found both thee and me; therefore I will hereafter use more severity in denying my self, and more diligence in seeking thee: For thou, Lord Jesu, art bountiful to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all I can ask or desire. Blessed be thou in all thy works; for though we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, yet thy goodness never ceaseth to do well to us, and thy mercy looks after us, though we turn away from thee.

                  <p>O my Lord &amp; my God, I am full of sorrow &amp; grief, that I have so little compunction, I most earnestly desire that thou wouldst wound my heart with perfect contrition,

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:174457:138"/> Father, for the full accomplishment of our Peace: Graciously apply to our Souls the infinite merits of thy sacred Passion, and with thy precious Blood cleanse us from all our Sins, nail them to thy Cross, and bury them in thy Grave, that they may die in us, and we live in thee, the life of Grace here, and be united to thee in the Kingdom of Glory hereafter, where, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, thou livest and reignest, one God, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>When their fury was angry against us, perhaps water hath swallowed us up.</p>
                  <p>Our Soul had passed through a Brook: perhaps our Soul had passed through an intolerable water.</p>
                  <p>Blessed be our Lord, who hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us for a prey to their teeth.</p>
                  <p>Our Soul as a Sparrow is delivered from the snare of the Fowlers.</p>

                  <p>Because our Lord will not leave the Rod of Sinners upon the lot of the just, that the just extend not their hands to Iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Do well, O Lord, to the good, and right of heart.</p>

                  <p>His Soul shall abide in good things: And his seed inherit the Land.</p>

                  <p>O Soveraign, dreadful, and most loving Lord, my God, who never ceasest to shew thy mercy towards Sinners; and even when they offend and trespass against thee, such is thine infinite clemency and Love, as thou forbearest not then to heap thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits upon them: I most sinful wretch, yield thee humble thanks for thy ineffable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in creating me to thine own likeness, and making me capable of thy everlasting
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:174457:141"/> Glory, in making so many other Creatures for my use and sustenance.</p>
                  <p>I bless thee for that inestimable work of my Redemption, whereby thou deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst me from the slavery of Satan, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasedst me free entrance into thy Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Kingdom. For having singled me out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many millions, that know thee not, and lie drowned in Ignorance, and miserable Errors, to be thy Servant and a member of the true Catholick Church. For thy blessed Sacraments; especially, for that glorious Mystery above all other, wherein thou art thy self most really contained. For preserving me so many times from Hell, which my Sins have long since deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, did not thy inestimable goodness su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain and deliver me. For these and all other thy benefits, namely, for those thou hast this day most bountifully bestowed on me, [<hi>Here are they particularly to be thought of</hi>] O my Sovereign Lord, I offer thee the most sincere, and most dutiful thanks, that my Poor Heart is capable to afford: Beseeching the blessed Virgin, and all the Saints of Heaven, to supply my want with their perfect praises.</p>
                  <p>And now, my only Redeemer and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:174457:141"/> I humbly crave the light of thy Grace, to know wherein I have this day any ways offended thee, and that, by mature &amp; sound discussion of my Conscience, I may see my own Sins with sorrow, and thy unspeakable mercy with a Zealous and firm purpose of amendment, [<hi>Here must we examine our selves, how we have employed the day, in thought, word and deed, toward God, &amp; our Neighbours.</hi>] Thou seest, O Lord, my Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and knowest my misery much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than my self. Sorry I am with all my Heart, that I should still offend so loving a Lord▪ and wish my sorrow were far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I purposed to do better by thy Grace, which was not wanting; yet have I faln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into my former trespasses. Thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, O Lord, forbids me to despair, and therefore I will continually trust to thy mercies in all events, and firmly resolve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day to amend my life. Deliver me, O my God, from all mortal Sin for ever, and give me Grace so to strive against my veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sins, that at last I may wholly overcome them. And for satisfaction of these▪ and all my former offences, and for the offences of the whole World, as also for thy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefits bestowed on me, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

               <p>BEfore thy Holy Eyes, O Lord, we humbly unfold our guilty lives.</p>
               <p>If we compare the faults we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the stripes we have received:</p>
               <p>We must confess the evils we have done, are greater far, then the evils which we suffer.</p>
               <p>The crimes that charge our Consciences are heavy, but the chastisements that come from thee are light.</p>
               <p>We feel the punishment of Sin, and still continue in the pertinacy of sinning.</p>
               <p>Our weak Nature faints under thy scourges, and our preverse wills grow stronger in their vices.</p>
               <p>Our restless minds find no content in the liberties of the World, yet will not our stiff necks bend to thy sweet Yoke.</p>
               <p>We sigh away our dayes in grief, yet all our sorrow works not the least amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our lives.</p>
               <p>If thou expect our repentance, we abuse thy mercy; if thou revenge our ingratitude we cannot bear thy Justice.</p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:174457:186"/>
               <p>Whilst under the rod we bewail our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; soon as the smart is past we forget our tears.</p>
               <p>If thou stretch out thy hand, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise duty; if thou suspend thy sword, we cease to pay our vows.</p>
               <p>If thou dost strike, we cry for pardon, and when thou hast pardoned, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thee again to strike.</p>
               <p>Thus we accuse our guilty selves, and freely avow, unless thou be merciful, we must be miserable.</p>
               <p>Let then thy goodness, Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our merits, grant our Prayers, whose power of nothing created us to pray; through Jesus Christ our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:174457:188"/> of thy goodness to wash me, with that Blessed Blood that issued out of thy tender Body in the divers torments of thy most bitter Passion.</p>
               <p>Take from me, O Lord, this luke-warm, or rather key-cold manner of meditation, and this dulness in Prayer: Give me fervor, and delight, in thinking on thee, and thy Grace, earnestly to desire thy holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and especially to rejoyce in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of thy Blessed Body (sweet Saviour Christ) in the holy Sacrament of the Altar: And dayly to thank thee for thy gracious Visitation therewith, and at that high me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial with tender compassion to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and consider thy most bitter Death upon the Cross.</p>

To thee, O Lord, all thy glorified Saints offer a just tribute of honour and adoration; nor is there any creature that can, according to thy worth, give thee sufficient praise. For thou art that unspeakable, incomprehensible, and everlasting goodness. Thou, O Lord, hast made me; thou hast, through the merits of the bitter passion of thy most blessed Son, restored me to the state of Salvation; to thee only is due all praise and honour, if any the least good be found in me. O my glorious Lord, I miserable sinner, a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thy making, desire to give thee praise with all my mind, and whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; but, without thy special grace, I find my self unable for the least performance: Wherefore I come to thee my God, my life and my strength, my hope and only
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:174457:209"/> comfort, craving thy merciful assistance, to give me power and capacity to praise thee.</p>
            <p>Grant me thy grace, that my mouth may speak, and my heart study thy glory, and my tongue be employed only in declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy excellencies; but because all praise in a Sinners mouth is unacceptable, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, most mighty Lord and Saviour, both inwardly and outwardly, that with heart and voice I may worthily praise thee</p>

            <p>O Most puissant and loving Lord, the great desire thou hadst of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was that which moved thee to leave us this Divine Sacrifice of the Mass; that as thy Triumphant Church hath her Sacrifice above, so thy Militant Church might have hers below. For as in Heaven thy Son conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually offers himself to thee, appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy face in a visible and glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to mediate for us; so hast thou vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed that on Earth he should daily be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thee by the function of Priests for our sins, in a manner invisible, and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our frailty. Yet it is all one and the self same Jesus Chtist, thy Son; from whose plessed presence is derived all the joy of Heaven, and all the hope of us sinners on Earth. This mystery most mighty Lord, is far surpassing all humane capacity, and yet most casie for those to believe, who have in time sucked the sweet milk of thy Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Doctrine.</p>
            <p>For mine own part, Lord, I believe (through thy gracious goodness) simply whatever thy Holy, Catholick, Apostolick and
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:174457:210"/> touching this, or any other of thy most Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries and Doctrines; and as thou hast said, thy Body and Blood is contained in this most holy Sacrament, and the very same Body to be likewise on the right hand of thy Father in Heaven: so I believe them both most assuredly, &amp; the one as firmly as the other, since both are equally the will &amp; work of the Almighty Word, God &amp; Man.</p>
            <p>Herein Iutterly renounce my sense, and all mans understanding, and adhere only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now therefore I beseech thee, most Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent God, to drive away all distractions and wicked thoughts out of my mind, that I may attend the celebration of this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mystery, with fear &amp; and reverent humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

            <p>I Confess to Almighty God, and to you my Ghostly Father, that, since my last Confession, I have divers wayes offended Almighty God.</p>
            <p>First, I accuse my self, that I have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry negligent in putting away evil thoughts of sundry sorts; and not kept my mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in Holy Cogitations, nor thought humbly of my self, I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>I accuse my self of many vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable words, &amp; that I have not spoken of my Neighbour, with that charity, as I would others should speak of me; nor had that compassion of others defects, as of my own; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>I accuse my self of my works, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done them so purely for the love of God, as I ought, but partly for some World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respect; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>I accuse my self, for not having kept my senses, so as I ought, especially my Eyes nor taken from my self and others, all
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:174457:226"/> occasions of offending God, as I ought; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>Also I accuse my self, for having been angry and impatient, and not taken every thing as of the Holy Hand of God; but often on little occasions been disquieted in mind; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>I accuse my self, for that I have not been so thankful to Almighty God for all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, as I ought; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>Also the last time I received the Blessed Sacrament, I did not behave my self so worthily in the presence of my Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as I ought; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>In my Prayers to Almighty God, I have admitted many distractions, whereto I have not made such speedy resistance as I ought; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>And I accuse my self, for not having prayed for mine Enemies and Persecutors, nor so heartily forgiven them as in Charity I ought; I cry God mercy for it.</p>
            <p>For all which, and whatever else I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at this present call to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, I beseech you my Ghostly Father, to pray to our Lord God for me, and to give me Absolution, and Penance.</p>

            <pb n="500" facs="tcp:174457:264"/>
            <p>I give thee most humble and hearty thanks, that, of a handful of dust &amp; nothing, thou wert pleased to make me after thine own Image, and capable of thy eternal Glory; for attainment whereof, thou hast vouchsafed, first to wash me with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Baptism, in remission of that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corruption, contracted in my first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, &amp; afterward hast brought me to the exercises and acts of a right Faith, not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing daily to increase the same in me by the Doctrine and Instruction of thy Church.</p>
            <p>I most humbly thank thee also, that from my Cradle thou hast nourished, and clothed me, supplying all things necessary for the relief &amp; maintenance of this my frail Body.</p>
            <p>I evermore extol and magnifie thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, that in thy great mercy thou hast hitherto spared, and patiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected me, till by thy Grace, I might be awaked from the sleep of Sin▪ and reclaimed from my vanities, and wicked courses. For hadst thou dealt with me according to my demerits, my Soul, long ere this (op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with innumerable Sins) had been plunged in Eternal Perdition.</p>
            <p>In respect of all which thy mercies and blessings, I most humbly desire, that my
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:174457:264"/> heart may every day be enlarged, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee a more ample tribute of praise and thanksgiving, then heretofore it hath done.</p>
            <p>O my Lord God, and most merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never leave me to my self, but let thy Holy fear be ever in my thoughts, to curb and keep me within the compass of thy obedience; that I may dread nothing so much in this World, as in the least sort to offend thee: Let thy Holy love so temper all Tryals, and temptations, which befall me, that none of them at any time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me, for thou knowest how frail I am of my self, and how my streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h is nothing.</p>
            <p>Moreover (most merciful Father) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, by the profound humility of thy only Son Jesus Christ, that thou wouldst preserve me from all Pride, and superfluity, all self-love and vain-glory, all obstinacy and disobedience. Cast out of my heart, I beseech thee, the Spirit of Gluttony &amp; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, the Spirit of Sloth and Indevoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Spirit of Malice and Envy, the Spirit of Hatred and Disdain; that I may never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise any of thy Creatures, nor proudly prefer my self before others, but always appear little in my own eyes, inclining to
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:174457:265"/> think the best of others, and still Judge the worst of my self.</p>
            <p>Invest me (most Holy Father) with the wedding Garment of thy beloved Son, the supernatural vertue of Heavenly Charity, that I may love thee, my Lord God, with all my Heart▪ with all my Soul, with all my Strength; that neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e affection to the transitory things of this World, may daily decay in me, that thou mayst be the only entertainment and delight of my Soul.</p>
            <p>O my gracious God! give thy Servant an humble, contrite and obedient Heart; an understanding alwayes employed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and pious cogitations, a will tractable, and ever inclined to do good, affections calm and moderate; a watchful Custody over my senses, that, by those Windows, no Sin may enter into my Soul▪ a perfect Government of my Tongue, that no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or unseemly language proceed from my lips, that I may never slander, or speak ill of any, nor busie my self in the faults and imperfections of others, but wholly attend to the amendment of mine own.</p>
            <pb n="503" facs="tcp:174457:265"/>
            <p>And finally (most loving Lord) so long as I am detained in this Prison of my Body, let this be my comfort, that, being free from all distractions both of the cares and pleasures of this Life, I may wholly devout my self to thy service, attending alwayes to thy Heavenly doctrine, and the good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy holy Spirit.
